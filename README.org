A minimal mode line for Emacs. Requires Emacs 30.

** Main features                                                :noexport_0:

- =Lordar-mode-line= includes only a few built-in segments.

- You can add your own segments, see the documentation for [[#custom-segments][instructions]].

- To share a segment, make a pull request and add it to [[file:custom-segments/custom-segments.org][custom-segments.org]]. I don't plan to add more segments to the code base to keep it small.

- By default, some major-mode-specific mode-line formats are defined and set up using major-mode hooks. You can disable/customize these or add your own.
