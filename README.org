* Modify the Template for Your New Package

When this template is used for a new package the following changes are needed:

- [ ] Add your package file(s). You can use the file [[file:my-package.el][my-package.el]] as a template.
- [ ] Remove the file [[file:my-package.el][my-package.el]].
- [ ] Change the main file in the [[file:Eldev::3][Eldev]]. 
- [ ] Add your tests in [[file:tests/][./tests]]. You can use =test-my-package.el= as a template which requires =test-helper.el=. This is an example of a file with auxiliary functions that can be used in other test files.
- [ ] Change the Emacs version that should be tested in [[file:.github/workflows/tests.yml][tests.yml]]. For linting and compiling the latest stable Emacs version is enough. Tests on the other hand should be done with the Emacs versions you want to support.
- [ ] Remove this section.
- [ ] Change the url of the [[file:README.org::39][badge]] to your repositiory.
