*** Testing
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: testing
:END:

Uses [[https://emacs-eask.github.io/Getting-Started/Introduction/][Eask]], which needs to be [[https://emacs-eask.github.io/Getting-Started/Install-Eask/#-npm-cross-platform][installed]]. The tests are written with [[https://github.com/jorgenschaefer/emacs-buttercup][Buttercup]]. After pushing to GitHub, an action is triggered which calls ~make all~. 

**** Testing locally

To test (lint & run tests) the package locally, call the Makefile target ~make test-local~.

To open Emacs with just the package installed run ~make emacs~. Like this you can test it interactively.

To see all make targets run ~make~.

***** Linters

When using ~make lint~, the following linters are used:

- package-lint
- elint
- checkdoc
- indent-lint 
- relint

If you want to use another linter or call a linter separately, use ~eask lint <name of linter>~. To get the available linters run ~eask lint~.

***** Test in Specific Emacs Version

It is possible to run an Eask command with specific Emacs version in a Docker container (Docker needs to be installed and configured to run without sudo).

To run the tests in a container use ~make docker-test emacs=29.4~.

To run an eask command in a docker container use:

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
  eask docker 29.4 test buttercup
#+END_SRC

- Unfortunately, I have not found a way to run the make targets (tried ~eask docker 29.4 exec make test~). 

- Sometimes after using a docker image ~eask clean all~ gives a long error with ~permission denied~ or ~No such file or directory~ at the end. If this happens run ~eask docker 29.4 clean all~.
  
- ~eask docker 29.4 emacs~ doesn't seem to work. I was able to launch an Emacs with the following command. The volumne has to be changed depending on where your have cloned the repository to:

  #+BEGIN_SRC shell
    eask docker 29.4 package
    eask docker 29.4 install
    docker run --interactive --tty \
        --volume ~/projects/coding/lordar-mode-line:/lordar-mode-line \
        --workdir /lordar-mode-line \
        --rm \
        silex/emacs:29.4-ci-eask emacs \
        --init-directory /lordar-mode-line/.eask/29.4
  #+END_SRC
