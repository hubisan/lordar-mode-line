*** Testing
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: testing
:END:

Uses [[https://github.com/doublep/eldev][Eldev]] which needs to be [[https://github.com/doublep/eldev#installation][installed]]. The tests are written with [[https://github.com/jorgenschaefer/emacs-buttercup][Buttercup]]. After pushing GitHub an action is triggered to automatically lint and runtests.

**** Testing locally

To test the package locally call the Makefile targets:

| Target          | Description                                          |
|-----------------+------------------------------------------------------|
| make help       | Show help for targets available                      |
| make all        | Run tests, lint and compile                          |
| make test       | Run tests                                            |
| make test-as-is | Run tests and use as-is instead of packaged (eldev)  |
| make lint       | Run linters                                          |
| make compile    | Byte-compile to check for errors/warnings            |
| make clean      | Clean everything                                     |
| make run-emacs  | Run Emacs with package and dependencies installed |

The output of Eldev is set to ~--quiet~. To produce more verbose output, run the make targets by setting the verbose parameter:

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
make all verbose=--trace # very verbose
make all verbose=--verbose # verbose
#+END_SRC


It is also possible to run the test with another Emacs version like so (Docker needs to be installed):

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
  # Run the test with Emacs version 25.3
  eldev docker 25.3 test
  # Launch Emacs 27.2 to test your package.
  eldev docker 27.2 emacs
#+END_SRC
